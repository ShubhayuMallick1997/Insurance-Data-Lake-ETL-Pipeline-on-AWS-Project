# 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an **enterprise-scale Data Engineering pipeline** for an Insurance Management System.

The objective is to simulate how insurance companies migrate operational data from a relational database into a cloud-based Data Lake, perform transformations using Apache Spark, create optimized analytical datasets, generate API-ready nested JSON documents, and prepare data for reporting and analytics.

The project follows a modern **Lakehouse architecture**, separating the pipeline into:

* Source Layer
* Raw Data Lake
* Curated Data Lake
* Analytics Layer
* Visualization Layer

The entire project was implemented using **Microsoft SQL Server, SSIS, AWS S3, Google Colab, PySpark, Athena and Power BI.**

---

# 🎯 Business Problem

Insurance companies store operational data across multiple normalized relational tables such as:

* Customer
* Policy
* Premium Payment
* Claims
* Products
* Agents
* Notifications
* Audit History

Business Intelligence tools, Machine Learning models and REST APIs cannot efficiently consume these normalized datasets directly.

Therefore, organizations typically build a Data Lake architecture to

* Centralize data
* Store multiple file formats
* Build optimized analytical datasets
* Generate API-ready JSON
* Support scalable analytics

This project simulates that complete workflow.

# Phase 2 — Initial Data Loading (SSMS)

After creating all database tables, sample insurance data was inserted into every table.

Data includes

* Customers
* Policies
* Claims
* Premium Payments
* Products
* Agents
* Notifications
* Audit Records

The objective was to simulate an operational insurance database.

---

# Phase 3 — ETL using SSIS

SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) was used to extract data from SQL Server.

## Source

```
SQL Server
```

↓

## Data Flow Tasks

Each table was connected individually using an OLE DB Source.

```
Customer

Policy

Claim

Premium Payment

Products

...

15 Tables
```

↓

## Data Conversion

Unicode and Non-Unicode datatype mismatches were handled using the **Data Conversion Transformation**.

Examples:

```
DT_STR

↓

DT_WSTR
```

```
TEXT

↓

Unicode String
```

This ensured successful export to Excel.

---

# Phase 4 — Excel Generation

Each SQL Server table was exported as an independent Excel file.

Generated files include:

```
Customer.xlsx

Policy.xlsx

Customer_Policy.xlsx

Premium_Payment.xlsx

Claim.xlsx

Claim_Document.xlsx

Products.xlsx

Product_Policy.xlsx

Agent.xlsx

Agent_Customer.xlsx

Branch.xlsx

Employee.xlsx

Notification.xlsx

Customer_Audit.xlsx

Users.xlsx
```

These Excel files represent the Raw Dataset extracted from the operational database.

# Phase 5 — AWS S3 Integration

AWS CLI was configured on the local system.

Configuration included:

```
IAM User

↓

Access Key

↓

Secret Access Key

↓

AWS CLI Configure
```

Connection verification

```
aws s3 ls
```

---

# Raw Layer Upload

Each generated Excel file was uploaded into the Raw Layer bucket.

```
Raw Layer

│

├── Customer.xlsx

├── Policy.xlsx

├── Customer_Policy.xlsx

├── Premium_Payment.xlsx

├── Claim.xlsx

├── Products.xlsx

├── Notification.xlsx

...

15 Excel Files
```

Purpose

* Preserve original source data
* Immutable raw storage
* Recovery point
* Data lineage

# Phase 6 — Google Colab

Google Colab was selected because Amazon EMR was intentionally avoided to keep the project within the AWS Free Tier.

Libraries installed:

```
boto3

pandas

pyspark

openpyxl
```

---

# Connecting Google Colab to AWS S3

AWS credentials were configured inside the notebook.

Workflow

```
Google Colab

↓

boto3

↓

AWS S3

↓

Download Excel Files
```

---

# Reading Excel Files

Using pandas

```python
pdf = pd.read_excel(...)
```

↓

Converted into Spark DataFrame

```python
customer_df = spark.createDataFrame(pdf)
```

---

# Spark Data Processing

Each dataset was validated using

```
show()

printSchema()

head()

count()
```

before conversion.

---

# Multi-format Data Generation

Each Spark DataFrame was converted into

```
CSV

JSON

ORC

PARQUET
```

using

```python
DataFrameWriter
```

Example

```
Spark DataFrame

↓

CSV

↓

JSON

↓

ORC

↓

PARQUET
```

---

# Generated File Structure

```
Customer_csv

Customer_json

Customer_orc

Customer_parquet

Policy_csv

Policy_json

...

15 Tables
×
4 Formats
```

Total output datasets

```
15 Tables

×

4 Formats

=

60 Output Datasets
```

---

# File Renaming

Since Apache Spark generates random

```
part-0000....
```

files,

Python automation was used to rename every output file into meaningful names.

Example

```
Customer_Data.parquet

Policy_Data.parquet

Claim_Data.json

Notification_Data.csv
```

---

# Phase 7 — Curated Layer Upload

After local verification, each generated dataset was uploaded to dedicated AWS S3 curated storage.

```
CSV Bucket

JSON Bucket

ORC Bucket

PARQUET Bucket
```

using AWS CLI.

# 📊 Analytics Layer

After the ETL pipeline successfully migrated the data into AWS S3 Curated Storage, the next objective was to build an analytical layer capable of serving Business Intelligence reports and API-ready datasets.

---

# Amazon Athena

Amazon Athena was selected as the serverless SQL query engine to analyze data stored in Amazon S3 without provisioning any servers.

Athena enables SQL queries directly on cloud storage and is ideal for data lake analytics.

---

```

---

# Athena Database

Example

```sql
CREATE DATABASE insurance_curated;
```

---

# External Tables

External tables were created on top of the Parquet datasets stored inside the Curated Layer.

Example tables

```text
Customer

Policy

Customer_Policy

Premium_Payment

Claim

Products

Notification

Customer_Audit
```

---

# Why Parquet?

Parquet was selected as the primary analytical format because it provides

* Columnar Storage
* Compression
* Predicate Pushdown
* Faster Scan Performance
* Reduced Storage Cost

Compared to CSV

| CSV          | Parquet         |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| Row Based    | Column Based    |
| Large Size   | Compressed      |
| Slow Queries | Fast Queries    |
| No Schema    | Embedded Schema |

# File Format Strategy

| Format  | Purpose            |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Excel   | Raw Extraction     |
| CSV     | Data Exchange      |
| JSON    | REST APIs          |

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM customer;
```

---

Example 2

Total Premium Collected

```sql
SELECT SUM(amount)
FROM premium_payment;
```

---

Example 3

Claims by Status

```sql
SELECT

GROUP BY claim_status;
```

---

Example 4

Products Under Each Policy

```sql
SELECT
pol_id,
COUNT(prod_id)
FROM product_policy
GROUP BY pol_id;
```

---

# Nested JSON Generation

One of the major objectives of this project was generating hierarchical JSON directly from SQL Server.

Instead of returning flat relational datasets, SQL Server's

```text
FOR JSON PATH
```

feature was used to build enterprise API responses.

---

# Nested JSON Hierarchy

```text
Customers
│
├── Customer
│
├── Agent Customer
│      │
│      └── Agent
│
├── Customer Policies
│      │
│      ├── Policy
│      │      │
│      │      └── Products
│      │               │
│      │               └── Product
│      │
│      ├── Claims
│      │      │
│      │      └── Claim Documents
│      │
│      └── Premium Payments
│
├── Notifications
│
└── Customer Audit
```

---

# REST API Ready JSON

The generated JSON structure closely resembles production REST APIs used by Insurance and Banking platforms.

Example

```json
{
  "cust_id": 1,
  "cust_name": "John",

  "Customer_Policies":[

      {

        "Policy":{

            "Products":[...]

        },

        "Claims":[...]

      }

  ],

  "Notifications":[...]

}
```

---

# Data Quality Validation

During the ETL process, several validations can be applied before writing curated datasets.

Examples

* Duplicate Customer Removal

* Email Standardization

* Mobile Number Validation

* Null Customer Removal

* Date Validation

* Invalid Premium Detection

* Invalid Claim Detection

---

# Curated Layer Objectives

The Curated Layer is optimized for

* Business Intelligence
